### Hi, I'm Roman VolkovðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ About me: 
      For 11 years I worked as a design engineer for water supply (airports, shopping malls, hotels, medicine, residential buildings and industrial enterprises):
      in 6 years I became a chief specialist, after 2 more years I became the head of a project group of 10 people, I have been working freelance for the last year.
      At work, I came across the tasks of writing scripts to automate drawing and calculations - that's how I got carried away with Python.
